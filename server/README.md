The server provides a forecasting REST API which has an end point converting the summoner name to summoner id. Once all the names have been mapped to their ids, the composition of the team is sent to the forecasting end point which uses those ids to query the last 20 matches of the players to generate their features and feed those to the loaded neural network. It finally returns the win chance.
