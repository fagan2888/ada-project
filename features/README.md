# Features generation

This code uses the player generated features to train a neural network to make predictions

Here is a brief summary of some key points:

* The neural net is coded using TensorFlow in the Neural_Network.ipynb file
* The model is saved in the finalmodel folder
* The Neural Net has 1 hidden layer of 110 neurons
* We use L2 regularization and dropout rate of 0.5 when training
